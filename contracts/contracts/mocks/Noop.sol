// This is a hack to ensure the protocol is deployed properly in the testing script. The problem is,
// the `InstantDistributionAgreementV1` contract uses an external contract, the
// `SlotsBitmapLibrary`. The only way Hardhat facilitates external library linking is via contract
// artifacts. However, unless the `InstantDistributionAgreementV1` contract is explicitly imported
// into the project, it won't be compiled and the artifact won't be generated.

// Hardhat has a dependency compiler extension, but developers have reported issues with usage in
// Node 14. This should go away with the publishing of the Superfluid hardhat deployer.
